List of all exercises
==============

E3
--------------
1. Ask for the value of the radius of a circumference and show the perimeter and area of the circle (input whole integers, aproximate result) {P= 2 * PI * r, A=PI * r * r}. Use DEFINE for constant PI.
2. Insert an integer in seconds and show its equivalence in hours, minutes and seconds.
3. Given a 4 digit whole number (1000-9999), split the digits and show them.

E4
--------------
1. Obtain the solution(s) of a quadratic equation with known coefficients (a,b,c).
2. Ask for a month and a year and show how many days are there in that month. Use the switch statement.
3. Calculate Newton's generalized binomial, asking for a and b as whole numbers. Newton's generalized binomial theorem: (a+b)^n = sum(n,i=0,n choose i) * a^(n-1) * b^n
4. Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. Given two integers, the program will decide if they are amicable numbers.

Exam 1
--------------
Create functions/procedures:

1. Given two three dimensional points with coordinates x,y,z; obtain the Manhattan (taxicab) distance between them.
2. Ask for an ammount of cents and print the equivalent in euros with the format (##0 000 000,00 â‚¬) (#=only if it applies).
3. Ask for an ammount of euros in the previous format and return the equivalent in cents.
